what is a git 
-> git is a version control system tools 
which helps as to track histroy of our code 
means we can track the changes happed in our code like which file is get creacted at what time also which files is updated etc
which file is deleted

2. and also its collaborate  and it free and open source


github
website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git


git comands 
clone - clone menas we are coping the code through github in our local machine means computer

status - git status command used to check the what all changes happend in our code

untracked-
new files that git doesn't yet track

modified - changed

ummodified - files not yet changed

staged - file is ready to be committed 
when we stage the files means clicking to + icon mean are file is add but not yet commited

commad 1 - git log --oneline => this will track the stage file and commited file(basically it show how many save pint means stages is done)
''      2 - git reset --hard HEAD~1 => this command go back to the previus stage or it delete the current stage
''     3 - git status => this will track which file is commited which untracked or updeted etc
 ''   4 - git status -s => this will show only thos file which are stage but not yet commited

branches in git 
=> it like new or separate version of the main repository
means insted of writting all the cod in main branch we are craeted different different braches & then if it correct branch  we are margeing in to main branch
to see all the branches - git branch
to create branch  - git branch branch_name
to switch the branch - git switch branch_name 
to cretae and switch brach at onace - got switch -c brach_namre (if branch is not exists)
to delete - git branch -d branch_name

**
git fetch - when there is person which clone the g it code and add some new code ten she/he upload that code in github
            and how use created main branch that person can access that code in his/here local machine using git fetch and if that code is correct then they can marge that code in main 

**
git stash
git stash apply

**
git pull - is used to fetch and integerate the changes which are present in the remote repository to the local repository
